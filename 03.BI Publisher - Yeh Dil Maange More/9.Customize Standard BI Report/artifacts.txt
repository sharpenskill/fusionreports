Scenario:

1. Customize AR Invoice Print Report
2. Add Payment term description column in data model
3. Add 2 new fields in the report output - term name and term description in the header section of the report

Take aways:

1. Though we can modify report template and data model query, but we cannot validate data using PL/SQL package like EBS system.
2. Fusion SaaS does not provide access to database, so we can't use of fusion database or can't call any database related custom program unit in report trigger.
3. We can't modify or hide the parameters used in standard report.
4. You must provide the values of flexfield. Those are actually lexical references in the report query.
